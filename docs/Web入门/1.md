    ![](../img/element.png)

3. Attributes (属性) 

    > 1. a space (空格)
    > 2. attribute name =  
    > 3. "attribute value"  
    >
    > Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace 
    >
    > (or any of the characters  " ' ` = < > ) can remain unquoted

    ![](../img/element-attribute.png)

4. Nesting elements (嵌套元素)

    > You can put elements inside other elements

5. empty elements (空元素)

    > have no content
    >
    > * <img\>

6. example

    * <html\>

        >  wraps all the content on the entire page 
        >
        > root element

    * <head\>

        > don't show
        >
        >  * keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, 
        >  * CSS to style our content, 
        >  * character set declarations and more.

    * <title\>

        > This sets the title of your page
        >
        > in the browser tab
        >
        > bookmark/favourite

    * <body\>

        > show

## 7. CSS basics (基础)

    > CSS is a style sheet language

* CSS ruleset(规则集)

    > The whole structure is called a ruleset. (rule)
    >
    > - Selector: HTML element name

    | Class selector                   | .my-class            |
    | Attribute selector               | img[src]             |
    | Pseudo-class selector            | a:hover              |

* Fonts and text (字体和文本)

    * Since <html\> is the parent element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the same font-size and font-family.

    * /* */: comment

* Boxes

    * CSS layout is mostly based on the box model

        > CSS 布局主要就是基于盒模型的

    * Each box's properties:

        * padding (内边距)

            > the space around the content

        * border (边框)

            > the solid line that is just outside the padding

        * margin (外边距)

            > the space around the outside of the border

        ![](../img/box-model.png)

        * width (of an element).

        * background-color

            > the color behind an element's content and padding.

        * color

            > the color of an element's content (usually text).

        * text-shadow 

            > sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.

        * display 

            > sets the display mode of an element. 

* note:

    > The <body> is a block element, meaning it takes up space on the page. 
    >
    > A block element can have margin and other spacing values applied to it. 
    >
    > In contrast, images are inline elements. 
    >
    > It is not possible to apply margin or spacing values to inline elements. 
    > 
    > So to apply margins to the image, we must give the image block-level behavior using "display: block;"
