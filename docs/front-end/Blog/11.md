## [1. JavaScript Module Pattern: In-Depth](http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html)

### The Basics

Eric Miraglia (of YUI) 第一次写博客提出

??? note "Anonymous Closures"

    ``` javascript
    (function () {
    	// ... all vars and functions are in this scope only
    	// still maintains access to all globals
    }());
    ```

    Notice the () around the anonymous function. This is required by the language, since statements that begin with the token function are always considered to be function declarations. Including () creates a function expression instead.

??? note "Global Import" 

    JavaScript has a feature known as implied globals. Whenever a name is used, the interpreter walks the scope chain backwards looking for a var statement for that name. If none is found, that variable is assumed to be global. If it’s used in an assignment, the global is created if it doesn’t already exist. This means that using or creating global variables in an anonymous closure is easy. Unfortunately, this leads to hard-to-manage code, as it’s not obvious (to humans) which variables are global in a given file.

    ``` javascript
    function f1(){
        n=999;
    }

    f1();

    alert(n); // 999
    ```

    By passing globals as parameters to our anonymous function, we import them into our code, which is both clearer and faster than implied globals. Here’s an example:

    ``` javascript
    (function ($, YAHOO) {
	    // now have access to globals jQuery (as $) and YAHOO in this code
    }(jQuery, YAHOO));
    ```


??? note "Module Export"

    Sometimes you don’t just want to use globals, but you want to declare them. We can easily do this by exporting them, using the anonymous function’s return value. Doing so will complete the basic module pattern, so here’s a complete example:

    ``` javascript
    var MODULE = (function () {
    	var my = {},
    		privateVariable = 1;

    	function privateMethod() {
    		// ...
    	}

    	my.moduleProperty = 1;
    	my.moduleMethod = function () {
    		// ...
    	};

    	return my;
    }());
    ```

## [2. JavaScript Module Pattern Basics in ES5.](https://coryrylan.com/blog/javascript-module-pattern-basics)

??? note

    Something to note, the next version of JavaScript ES6 has a new specification for asynchronous module loading. You can use the module patterns that will be covered with the new ES6 module loading syntax.

??? note "Creating a module"

    anonymous closure

    ``` javascript
    (function() {
      'use strict';
      // Your code here
      // All function and variables are scoped to this function
    })();
    ```

    This pattern is well known as a Immediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE. The function is evaluated then immediately invoked. Its also a good practice to run your modules in ES5 strict mode. Strict mode will protect you from some of the more dangerous parts in JavaScript.


??? note "Exporting our module"

    This basically assigns the module to a variable that we can use to call our modules methods.

    Next lets create a public method for our module to call. To expose this method to code outside our module we return an Object with the methods defined.

    ``` javascript
    var myModule = (function() {
      'use strict';

      return {
        publicMethod: function() {
          console.log('Hello World!');
        }
      };
    })();

    myModule.publicMethod(); // outputs 'Hello World'
    ```

??? note "Private methods & properties"

    ``` javascript
    var myModule = (function() {
      'use strict';

      var _privateProperty = 'Hello World';

      function _privateMethod() {
        console.log(_privateProperty);
      }

      return {
        publicMethod: function() {
          _privateMethod();
        }
      };
    })();

    myModule.publicMethod(); // outputs 'Hello World'
    console.log(myModule._privateProperty); // is undefined protected by the module closure
    myModule._privateMethod(); // is TypeError protected by the module closure
    ```

??? note "Revealing Module Pattern"

    The Revealing Module Pattern is one of the most popular ways of creating modules. Using the return statement we can return a object literal that ‘reveals’ only the methods or properties we want to be publicly available.

    ``` javascript
    var myModule = (function() {
      'use strict';

      var _privateProperty = 'Hello World';
      var publicProperty = 'I am a public property';

      function _privateMethod() {
        console.log(_privateProperty);
      }

      function publicMethod() {
        _privateMethod();
      }

      return {
        publicMethod: publicMethod,
        publicProperty: publicProperty
      };
    })();

    myModule.publicMethod(); // outputs 'Hello World'
    console.log(myModule.publicProperty); // outputs 'I am a public property'
    console.log(myModule._privateProperty); // is undefined protected by the module closure
    myModule._privateMethod(); // is TypeError protected by the module closure
    ```

    The benefit to the Revealing Module Pattern is that we can look at the bottom of our modules and quickly see what is publicly available for use.

    The Module Pattern is not a silver bullet (银子弹，据传为可以杀死狼人 werewolf 的唯一武器。) for adding code re-usability to your JavaScript. Using the Module Pattern with Prototypal Inheritance or ES6 Classes can give you a wide range of design patterns with varying pros and cons.
