## 1) Internet

* Internet: infrastructure / Web: service
* router(路由器)
* IP address: 192.168.2.10

## 2) web page, website, web server, and search engine

| library                                     | a web server  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| sections<br> (science, math, history, etc.) | websites      |
| books                                       | webpages      |
| search index                                | search engine |

## 3) web server

* An HTTP server: 

    > 一个软件：理解 URLs (web addresses) 和 HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages).

* A static web server:

    > 电脑 (硬件) + an HTTP server (软件)

* A dynamic web server

    > a static web server + 额外的软件, 
    > 
    > 最常见的是 an application server and a database

## 4) set up (设置) a local testing server

* URL localhost:8000

## 5) ? Dealing with files

* writing your folder and file names 

    * lowercase
    * no spaces
    * dashes

## 6) HTML basics (基础)

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

    > is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
    >
    > not a programming language; it is a markup language

2. HTML consists of a series of elements (元素)

    > wrap different parts of the content

    ![](../img/element.png)

3. Attributes (属性) 

    > 1. a space (空格)
    > 2. attribute name =  
    > 3. "attribute value"  
    >
    > Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace 
    >
    > (or any of the characters  " ' ` = < > ) can remain unquoted

    ![](../img/element-attribute.png)

4. Nesting elements (嵌套元素)

    > You can put elements inside other elements

5. empty elements (空元素)

    > have no content
    >
    > * <img\>

6. example

    * <html\>

        >  wraps all the content on the entire page 
        >
        > root element

    * <head\>

        > don't show
        >
        >  * keywords and a page description that would appear in search results,
        >  * CSS to style content, 
        >  * character set declarations, and more.

    * <title\>

        > This sets the title of the page
        >
        > in the browser tab
        >
        > bookmark/favourite

    * <body\>

        > show

7. <img\>

    * alt(alternative)

        * specify "descriptive text" for users who cannot see the image

            1. visually impaired (视觉障碍)
            2. Something has gone wrong
          
8. Marking up text (标记文本)  

    *  essential HTML elements (基本元素)

    1. Headings (标题)  

        > <h1\> - <h6\>

    2. Paragraphs (段落)  

        > <p\>

    3. Lists (列表)  

        > always consist of at least 2 elements.   
        >
        > The most common list types: 
        >
        > 1. ordered lists: <ol\>
        > 2. unordered lists: <ul\>  
        >
        > list item: <li\>

    4. Links (链接)  

        > <a\>: anchor  
        > 
        > * href: hypertext reference

## 7) CSS basics (基础)

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): 层叠样式表 

    >  the code that styles web content
    >
    > not a programming language, not a markup language either.  
    >
    > CSS is a style sheet language

* CSS ruleset(规则集)

    > The whole structure is called a ruleset. (referred-to as just rule)
    >
    > - Selector: HTML element name
    > - Declaration: a single rule

    ![](../img/css-declaration.png)


* Different types of selectors (不同类型的选择器)

    * 常用选择器

    | Selector name                    | Example              |
    | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
    | Element selector (type selector) | p                    |
    | ID selector                      | #my-id(FF: [id=xxx]) |
    | Class selector                   | .my-class            |
    | Attribute selector               | img[src]             |
    | Pseudo-class selector            | a:hover              |

    > Pseudo-class selector: The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.)

* Fonts and text (字体和文本)

    * Since <html\> is the parent element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the same font-size and font-family.

    * /\* \*/: comment

* CSS: all about boxes

    * CSS layout is mostly based on the box model

        > CSS 布局主要就是基于盒模型的

    * Each box's properties:

        1. padding (内边距)

            > the space around the content

        2. border (边框)

            > the solid line that is just outside the padding

        3. margin (外边距)

            > the space around the outside of the border
            >
            > ![](../img/box-model.png)

        4. width (of an element).

        5. background-color

            > the color behind an element's content and padding.

        6. color

            > the color of an element's content (usually text).

        7. text-shadow 

            > sets a drop shadow on the text inside an element.

        8. display 

            > sets the display mode of an element. 

## 8) JavaScript basics

1.  JavaScript

    > full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity to a website
    >
    > ("JS" for short)

    * relatively compact, yet very flexible (简洁，灵活)

    * tools

        * Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
        * Third-party APIs
        * Third-party frameworks and libraries

2.  Language basics crash course (快速入门)

    * Variables

        > containers that store values
        >
        > case sensitive (区分大小写)

                let myVariable;

        * 变量可以有不同的 数据类型 ：

        | Variable | Example                                                                           |
        | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | String   | let myVariable = 'Bob';                                                           |
        | Number   | let myVariable = 10;                                                              |
        | Boolean  | let myVariable = true;                                                            |
        | Array    | let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];                                            |
        | Object   | let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');<br> All of the above examples too. |

        > JavaScript 里一切皆对象，一切皆可储存在变量里。

    * Comments

            /*
            Everything in between is a comment.
            */

            // This is a comment

    * Operators (运算符)

        > An operator is a mathematical symbol (数学符号) which produces a result based on two values (or variables)
        >
        > 还有一元运算符，三元运算符

        * +
        * -, *, /
        * =
        * ===: 返回布尔值
        * !, !==

    * Conditionals (条件语句)
    * Functions (函数)
    * Events (事件)

            document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {
                alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');
            }

3. 其他

    * Null is a special value in JavaScript that refers to the absence of a value.

## 9) How the Web works

1. Clients and servers (客户端和服务器) 及其他

    ![](../img/Client-server.jpg)

    * web: road (路)
    * client: your house (家)
    * server: shop (商店)
    * internet connection: street (街道)
    * TCP/IP: a car or a bike
    * DNS: address book (通信录) for shops (websites)
    * HTTP:  language you use to order your goods (下订单)
    * Component files (组成文件): different parts of the goods you buy from the shop

        > 分为：
        >
        >   1. Code files (代码): HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ...
        >
        >   2. Assets (资源): images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs ...
        >

2. what happens

    1. The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on 

        > (you find the address of the shop).

    2. The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client 

        > (you go to the shop and order your goods)

    3. If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets 

        > (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring them back to your house).

    4. The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you 

        > (the goods arrive at your door — new shiny stuff, awesome!).
